# Exercism Solutions in C

Exercism allows a professional working with the language to mentor you.  After the first few solutions I submitted got excellent feedback, I decided to start a repository and save my original solutions, then update them with the suggestions from the mentors.

I'll also now be using the VSCode integration they have, instead of using the online code editor.

Each challenge will likely be a separate C file, but I may later need to group these into folders if more header files are required.
